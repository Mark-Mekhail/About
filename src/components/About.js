      <p>
        Hey there! Thanks for checking out my page. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I'm Mark Mekhail, a senior Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). 
        I have completed co-op work terms in Software Engineering, Simulation Software Engineering, Full-Stack 
        web development, and Backend development at medium to large organizations in the National Defense, 
        Software Tools, Electronics, and Semiconductor industries. I'm hoping to continue expanding the 
        breadth of my experience in the software space while also honing and refining my current skills.
