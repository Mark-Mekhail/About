# About-Mark
## Description
This is a repository containing the code I wrote for my [personal website](https://mark-mekhail.github.io/About-Mark/).

## Technical Details
### Development Tools and Languages
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **npm**: Node package manager used for managing project dependencies.

### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are set up using GitHub Actions. This ensures that the code is automatically validated and deployed whenever changes are made to the repository.

### Linting Tools
- **ESLint**: A linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. The project uses a custom ESLint configuration to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
- **Stylelint**: A linter for CSS and other stylesheets that helps avoid errors and enforce consistent conventions in styles.

### Folder Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the project.
- **public/**: Contains the public assets such as HTML files and images.
- **.github/**: Contains GitHub-specific files such as workflows and composite actions for CI/CD.

### Deployment
- The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, which hosts the static files generated by the build process.
