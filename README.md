# About-Me
## Description
This is a repository containing the code I wrote for my [personal website](https://mark-mekhail.github.io/About-Me/).

## Deployment
The npm [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) cli is used to publish a build of the react app to a ```gh-pages``` branch from which the [GitHub pages site](https://mark-mekhail.github.io/About-Me/) is built.
