# About
## Description
This is a repository containing the code I wrote for my [personal website](https://mark-mekhail.github.io/About/).

## Technical Details
### Development Tools and Languages
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **npm**: Node package manager used for managing project dependencies.

### Testing Tools
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used for writing unit and integration tests.
- **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components used in conjunction with Jest to test user interactions and component behavior.
- **Cypress**: A testing framework for end-to-end testing of the entire application flow.

### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are set up using GitHub Actions. This ensures that the code is automatically validated and deployed whenever changes are made to the repository.

### Linting Tools
- **ESLint**: A linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. The project uses a custom ESLint configuration to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
- **Stylelint**: A linter for CSS and other stylesheets that helps avoid errors and enforce consistent conventions in styles.

### Folder Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the project.
- **public/**: Contains public assets such as HTML files and some images.
- **.github/**: Contains GitHub-specific files such as workflows and composite actions for CI/CD.

### Deployment
- The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, which hosts the static files generated by the build process.

### Scripts
The following scripts are available in the project:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm test`: Runs the Jest unit/integration test suite.
- `npm run cypress:run`: Runs the Cypress end-to-end test suite.
- `npm run lint`: Validates project code style using Prettier, and lints with ESLint and Stylelint.`

Make sure to run `npm install` to install the project dependencies before running any of the scripts.
